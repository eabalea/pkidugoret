```

createasubca.sh script need's a subject string openssl-ed style.
Creating a SUB CA named SUBTEST1 issued by TEST with the subject o = TEST, OU = TEST , CN = TESTSUB1, createasubca.sh should be launched with the following arguments :
```shell
./createsubca.sh -i TEST -c SUBTEST1 -s "/O=TEST /OU=TEST /CN=TESTSUB1"
```

Create a user
=============
createuser.sh script need's a subject string openssl-ed style.
Creating a user called usertest, issued by the SUBTEST1 CA with the subject o = TEST, OU = TEST , CN = usertest1, createuser.sh should be launched with the following arguments :
```shell
./createuser.sh -i usertest -c SUBTEST1 -s "/O=TEST /OU=TEST /CN=usertest1"
```

Revoke au user
==============
Usertest1 was a bad guys or maybe you screwed somewhere, you need to revoke the certificate, revokeuser.sh should be launched nervously with the following arguments :

./revokeuser.sh -i usertest -c SUBTEST1
```

Create a CRL

You want the entire world to know that usertest1 was a ~~n~~ ~~asshole~~ bad guys, you need to create a CRL for the SUB CA called SUBTEST1 for a validity period of 7 days, createcrl.sh should be launched with the following arguments :
